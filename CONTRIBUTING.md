Thanks for contributing to this proof of concept!

The first thing I would like to emphasize is that this crate is **NOT** meant for and serious use. It is only to serve and a reference implementation in the ptr-to-field RFC. If that RFC ever closes, or gets merged then this repo will be archived. This crate will also never be uploaded to crates.io.
